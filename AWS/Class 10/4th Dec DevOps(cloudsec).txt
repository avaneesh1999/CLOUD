AWS Shared Responsibility Model 

- AWS Responsibility - Security of the cloud 
	- Hardware, Software, facilities & networking part 
	
- Managed services like S3, DynamoDB, RDS etc. 


**** Customer 
	- EC2 instances, management of OS , firewall, network configuration, IAM 
	- Encryption 
	
- Shared Controls :
	- Patch management, Configuration Management, Awareness && Training


*******************RDS (Security)**************************************
Your responsibility :- 
- Check the ports / IP address / security groups Inbound rule in DB
- In-database = user creation and permission, Database access 
- Database encryption 
- Only allow SSL connection 

AWS Responsibility :- 
- Manage your EC2 instance, disable SSH access or whitelist any individual IP Address
- Automated OS & DB patching 
- Instances in Disk and gurantee it functions

***************************S3**********************************
Your Responsibility :- 
- Basic Configuration
- Bucket Policies
- IAM user and roles
- Enable Encryption

AWS Responsibility:- 
- Unlimited Storage 
- Encryption 
- Seperation of data
- AWS ensures that without appropriate permission, no employee can access that data. 


What is DDOS? 
Distributed denial of service 


ATTACKER ------1-----2----3----4---5(Master Machine) ------ so many bots ------- Application server

DDOS protection for AWS 

1. AWS Shield > a) Standard ------ no additional cost 
				b) Advanced ------ 24/7 DDOS prtotection 
2. AWS WAF : Filter specific request based on rules
3. Cloud front 

user ------route53  (AWS Shield) -------Cloud front distribution (AWS WAF)-------> security group (AWS Shield) -------Public subnets

AWS Shield :- 
Standard :- Free service that is activated for every AWS customer
			SYN / UDP floods, Reflection attacks  & other 3rd and 4th Layer attacks
			

Advanced Version :-  DDOS Mitigation ----24/7 -----along with assistance ($3000 per month & per organistaion) 
			- EC2, ELB, Cloud Front, Route53
			
			(DRP Team) - Ddos response team 
			
AWS WAF :- 
- Protect your web apps which Layers 7 (application layer) 
  ALB, API Gateway, Cloudfront
  
Web ACL (Access control List) 
- IP Address, HTTP Header, URL Strings 
- Protecting from common attacks :- SQL Injection, Cross - Site SCripting (XSS) 
- Geo-match (block the region where you don't wish to show your product) 

Pentesting or penetration testing operation on AWS Cloud
(VAPT) Vulnerability assessment & Pentesting 




- EC2 ---- NAT Gateways & ELB
- RDS
- Cloud front
- Aurora 
- API Gateways 
- AWS Lambda functions 
- Lightsail 
- Beanstalk environment


AWS Prohibited activities 

1. DNS zone walking via Amazon route 53 hosted zone
2. DOS & DDos
3. Port flooding
4. Protocol flooding
5. Request flooding (Login request flooding, API request flooding)

*********DATA AT REST VS DATA IN TRANSIT ******************

Encrypted data at rest EFS -------------Encrypted in transit while uploading--------Encrypted at rest on S3

At rest :- data that is stored or archived on device 

In transit (in motion)

We want to encrypt data in both the states 

******************************AWS KMS for that ***********************

KMS = AWS manages the encyption keys for us

Encryption OPT IN :- 
1. RDS database 
2. EFS 
3. Redshift databases 
4. S3 
5. EBS Volumes

Automatically enabled encrypyted service by AWS 

1. S3 
2. Cloudtrail logs 
3. Storage Gateway

Cloud HSM :- 
KMS => AWS manages the software for encryption
Cloud HSM => AWS provisioned encyption hardware
Dedicated hardware => HardwareSecurity 



**********************AWS Certificate manager (ACM) 

- SSL/TLS Certificate
- TLS certificate are free of charge 
- Integration :- 
	ELB
	Cloudfront 
	API's and on API Gateway
	
*******************AWS secret Manager***********************

- Store encrypted credentials for RDS DB, DOC DB, REDSHIFT, API KEY or Token

- Store plain text passwords as well in here. 
- Rotation password can be done on the basis of hours, minutes, days 

******************Compliance*******************************
