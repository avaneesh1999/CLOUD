VPC  : Virtual Private Cloud 

- VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateways & NAT Gateways 
- Security groups, NACL, VPC Flow logs
- VPC peering & VPC End points 

VPC : Deploy your resources 

Subnets :- Allow you to partition your network inside your VPC 

Public Subnet :- It is a subnet that is accessible from internet

Private Subnet :- It is a subnet that is not accessible from internet


VPC -------> EC ---> Public Private 

AWS Cloud 
                           Region
AZ1  											   AZ2 
VPC (Subnet)								     (subnets)


Internet Gateways 													
- Help our VPC instances to connect with the internet





NAT Gateways  : Managed by AWS 
It will allow your instance in your private subnets to access internet while remaining private

Assignment :-  - Create your own new custom VPC
- And configure your EC2 linux instance inside your custom VPC 
- and then create 3 subnets of that VPC 
- Attach an internet gateway to your custom VPC


Network access control list & Security Groups :- 

(VPC) --------> Public Subnet    (NACL & Security Group) 

- Allow and Deny Rules
- They are attached at Subnet level only 
- Rules only includes IP Address

Security Groups :- 
- It is a firewall that controls traffic to and from an EC2 instance
- Can have only allow rules 
- Configure and apply security groups 


    NACL            						vs 							    Security Groups
- Operated at the subnet level								Operates on Instance Level
- Supports allow and deny rules only						Supports allow rules
- Is stateless :- 									Stateful :- Return traffic that is automatically allowed, regardless of any rules
It is going to return traffic that must								
be explicitly allowed by rules

VPC Peering 

- If you want to use 2 VPC's or more, privately using AWS network we use peering
- Make them behave as if they are in same network 


VPC A <-------------VPC Peering----------------> VPC B

VPC C

- You can peer VPC in multiple region 
- You peer VPC's in between multiple AWS aacounts


VPC End Points :- 

VPC end points is allowing you to connect various AWS services using private network of the public 
www network
