Amazon VPC : 
is a Virtual Private Cloud, and it lets you provision a logically 
isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network you define: selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and more. 
It is like a virtual data center in the cloud.

There are two types of DBs, relational and non-relational: 
* The relational DB is called RDS (Relational Database Service) 
* The non-relational DB is called DynamoDB. (No-Sql) MongoDB JSON/Documents

6 different DB services: 
* SQL Server by Microsoft  -- ROW AND COLUMN -- TABULAR
* Oracle
* MySQL server
* PostgreSQL
* Amazon Aurora
* MariaDB

RDS: SQL 
Non-Relational: No-Sql Database Dynamo DB

 
Two Key Features RDS: 
Multi-AZ Deployments and Read Replicas

-------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability for database instances within a single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby instance in a different AZ.
In the event of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic fail-over to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications without administrative intervention.

Multi-AZ Use Cases
To get high availability, and enhance availability during planned system maintenance, and help protect databases against DB instance failure and Availability Zone disruption.
To get data redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency spikes during system backups.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amazon RDS Read Replicas enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS Region to increase the scalability.

Updates made to source database are then asynchronously copied to Read Replicas. 
Writes can happen in main database only and reads can happen in Read replica database.

OLTP( Online Transaction Processing) vs OLAP ( Online Analytics processing)


OLTP --> RDS/SQL Databases/ Tabular Databases , Short Term Processing/ Trasaction
OLAP Systems are the example of Data Warehousing. --->Longer Term!

Data Analysis, Data Cleaning ---> OLAP ----> AWS Redshift, DeltaLakes



What is Cache?

* Caching is a mechanism to improve the performance of any type of application. 
Technically, caching is the process of storing and accessing data from a cache. 

* A cache is a software or hardware component aimed at storing data so that future requests for the same data can be served faster.

ElastiCache: a web service that makes it easy to operate. 
The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from from fast in-memory caches. 
instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases.

ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory caching engines:

* Memcached
* Redis

Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for Amazon DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10 times performance improvement—from milliseconds to microseconds—even at millions of requests per second.


Table name	    Primary key
ProductCatalog	Partition key: Id (Number)



Redis or Memhanched (PORT NO, DNS/IP) Username and Passowrd :  ----> EC2 Instance 

redis module , ping onto the endpoint cluster on/off
redis pkg ---> connection

MYSQL/ AWS ---> RDS(EC2)  / NOSQL(Connection String)


AWS Redshift: JDBC Connector(Module to Connect through database/ java Java Database Connector)


10X Speed in processing same request/caching?

REDIS: 5 sec
Memchached: 6 sec
DynamoDB+REDIS: 7sec
DynamoDB+DAX: 2 milisec million

DynamoDB acelltor is new way of getting better performance
